# Slipping Gate - ESP32 Single Button Game

Slipping Gate is a simple yet engaging game created as part of an internal competition at Intel, challenging employees to design entertaining games using only a single push button with ESP32 microcontroller.

## Game Overview

In Slipping Gate, players aim to maneuver an object (represented by a square) from point A to point B while avoiding contact with moving lines (gates) as quickly as possible. By clicking on the button, the square will move to the left.

## Hardware and Software Requirements

### Hardware:
- ESP32 microcontroller
- SSD1306 128x64 small screen
- Breadboard
- Push button
- Buzzer
- Wires

### Software:
- Thonny IDE
- Python

## Installation and Setup

### Requirements:
- Thonny IDE
- ESP32 microcontroller
- SSD1306 128x64 small screen
- Breadboard
- Push button
- Buzzer
- Wires

### Steps:
1. Install Thonny IDE on your system.
2. Connect the ESP32 microcontroller and hardware components following the provided circuit design.
3. Copy the project files to the microcontroller:
